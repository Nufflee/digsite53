/* 
This is a custom VS Code tmLanguage entry for this project's attr_serialize_* attributes. 
Using it is not recommended as it requires monkey-patching your vscode-ruby extension. 
In short, you have to add these entries to "patterns" in `~/.vscode/extensions/wingrunr21.vscode-ruby-<INSERT VERSION HERE>/syntaxes/ruby.cson.json` and reload your VS Code. 
This will get reverted every time the extension is updated so a better solution will have to be found.
